AE-LogMailer
=========

Simple batch script to operate Blat and 7Zip to mail e.g. log files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm definitely NOT a developer, I can hardly write small scripts with good old batch being my weapon of choice.
I've created this script to help on many different projects I'm involved in. Almost all error checking always starts by support asking to send log files. To make this quick and easy for users that are enlightened enough to double click, I've created this.
